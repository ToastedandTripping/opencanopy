# OpenCanopy — Roadmap

BC forest map: faithful government data rendered as PMTiles, served as a
public conservation reference. Architecture decision in March: base tileset
is government-truthful only; synthesis layers (fire-age reconciliation,
disturbance models) live as separate layers and are not part of the
open-source base.

## Reference

- Architecture: `state/plans/opencanopy-audit-architecture.md`
- Audit pipeline: `tools/audit/` (7-audit suite — source-to-tile tracing,
  geometry precision, spatial validation, adversarial testing, cross-source
  consistency, deep property validation, unified runner)
- Repo: github.com/ToastedandTripping/opencanopy
- Outstanding audit items (non-blocking):
  - Okanagan Lake V3 test point needs adjustment
  - tenure-cutblocks DISTURBANCE_START_DATE property issue
  - Cross-source R1 reclassify as informational (BC VRI data limitation)
